The wiring diagram is a little hard to read, but this is mostly due to the RGB LEDS. Make sure you identify you LED as common anode or common cathode. <br>

<br>
<br>

How to use the counter: <br>
Use the keys to increase or decrease life total. Press both keys simultaneously to change your color (Red, green, blue, purple, and white) or to turn the LED off. <br>
Hold the two keys to reset your life total. <br>

<br>
<br>

To be fixed: <br>
-Changing color affects life total <br>
-Holding keys to reset life also cycles through LED colors <br>
