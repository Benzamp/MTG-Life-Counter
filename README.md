The wiring diagram is a little hard to read, but this is mostly due to the RGB LEDS. Make sure you identify you LED as common anode or common cathode. 

How to use the counter:
Use the keys to increase or decrease life total. Press both keys simultaneously to change your color (Red, green, blue, purple, and white) or to turn the LED off.
Hold the two keys to reset your life total

To be fixed:
-Changing color affects life total
-Holding keys to reset life also cycles through LED colors
